## Abstract
In construction projects, optimizing flooring planning schemes is of great significance for reducing material loss and construction costs. Although a large number of studies have proposed solutions to this problem, most methods rely on traditional algorithms and suffer from insufficient accuracy or low efficiency. This research introduces and validates an emerging black box optimization algorithm, RBFOpt (Bayesian Ridge Function Optimization), to evaluate its applicability and performance in optimizing tiling planning problems. A cost calculation platform was developed based on parametric modeling and BIM technology, combined with RBFOpt algorithm for scheme generation and evaluation. The experimental results show that the RBFOpt algorithm can effectively reduce the cost of ground material use in multiple testing scenarios, with an average savings rate of 10% to 20%, demonstrating strong optimization capabilities. However, the algorithm is not stable enough in terms of convergence speed, and in some cases, there is a problem of long computation time. Overall, the RBFOpt algorithm has broad application prospects in optimizing building tiling planning, but the reasons that restrict its calculation speed still need further research.

## 1 Introduction
### 1.1 Research Background
Due to various complex reasons, material waste in the construction industry remains a significant issue in both economic and environmental aspects. In 2022, global construction and demolition (C&D) waste accounted for 30-40% of total solid waste, with up to 30% of all building materials transported to construction sites ultimately becoming waste. In addition, the United States generated approximately 600 million tons of construction and demolition waste in 2018, of which less than 145 million tons were sent to landfills, and the rest were mainly reused as aggregates (BigRentz, 2024). In this extensive waste stream, the scraps of carpets, wooden and ceramic flooring are a significant source of losses that have not been fully improved (Contract Flooring Association, 2021). Due to the lack of sufficient planning for various environments throughout the entire process, contractors often handle vinyl, carpet, and wood scraps in general waste streams. Due to low efficiency, over 75% of wood waste ends up in landfills, causing negative impacts on the environment and economy. The loss caused by lack of management in various processes of construction production is one of the reasons for the huge waste of flooring materials. And one of the sub problems is the inefficiency of material management in flooring installation. The obvious fact is that although the flooring is manufactured in standardized sizes in the factory, it is difficult for these flooring to fit snugly in the rooms on site. In order to adapt to the room size, workers need to cut some floors on site, which results in a lot of time and material waste. The industry urgently needs a simple and efficient optimization tool to reduce waste.
There have been numerous studies on how to lay flooring in the most cost-effective way within a given plane. For example, we can abstract it as a planar tiling or tiling problem, which has been extensively studied in discrete geometry, combinatorial geometry, and computational geometry. Another approach is the cutting inventory problem (CSP) that operations research has long been dedicated to solving. Two dimensional CSP focuses on efficiently installing the required cutting parts onto inventory boards. In terms of engineering applications, some studies in architecture and engineering management have utilized the above theories to implement algorithms based on specific scenarios (B ł a ż ewicz et al., 1991). However, these studies have not been fully promoted in practice. To investigate the reasons, firstly, these studies mainly target single patterns and lack support for complex patterns such as interlocking, herringbone, or diagonal lines; Secondly, research from practical disciplines still lacks understanding and application of contemporary cutting-edge scientific achievements, showing a certain lag; The fact that not every edge of modern prefabricated wooden flooring can be connected to each other also makes this issue more complex; The lack of software products in the market that can transform the above achievements into floor laying optimization with human-machine efficiency may be one result and another reason.
### 1.2 Research Target
This research will apply the latest achievements in the field of computer science, based on geometric layout data, to seek the optimal laying scheme according to the size and pattern of the laying materials, and generate a ready cutting list and cost estimate on site. This method aims to reduce material loss and labor time caused by on-site cutting, and ultimately reduce overall costs. The main objective of this study is to compare and evaluate the performance of the RBFOpt algorithm with traditional manual methods.
1.3Research Significance
In the past five years, the global cost of renovation materials has increased by 38% (Tigranyan and Melkonyan, 2024), and a practical floor laying optimization algorithm and its client software have potential and urgent market demand. Even a moderate reduction in waste of flooring materials can translate into significant financial savings, as material costs typically account for 30-40% of the total building budget. This study will explore whether more suitable algorithms can be found for this problem. And lay the foundation for its industrial application.
## 2 Literature Review
### 2.1 Introduction
The tile layout planning problem involves determining the optimal arrangement and cutting of tiles to cover a given surface, and is a classic problem in the fields of construction management, mathematics, and computer science. With the increasing demand for efficient and economical construction methods, especially in high-precision environments such as floor, wall, and facade systems, the development of advanced algorithms has received widespread attention from both academia and industry.
Traditional handmade tile planning often leads to excessive material waste, increased labor time, and poor aesthetic effects. In contrast, digital solutions aim to minimize tile cutting, reduce material loss, and adapt to constraints such as tile size, pattern alignment, and installation rules by pre generating efficient layout schemes. These algorithms can be roughly divided into rule-based heuristic methods, combinatorial optimization techniques, and recent artificial intelligence based models, including evolutionary algorithms and deep learning. The progress of digital architecture and parametric modeling has enabled the integration of tile layout algorithms with Building Information Modeling (BIM), allowing for real-time visualization, quantity statistics, and constructability analysis. This provides a technical foundation for algorithm applications. For further research, it is necessary to clarify the basic concepts involved and find the latest theoretical support.
### 2.2 Review of Key Concepts and Theories
#### 2.2.1 BIM
BIM， The Building Information Model, also defined as a "shared digital representation," supports decision-making throughout the entire facility lifecycle from planning to operation. It has become a transformative approach in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. Since its proposal twenty years ago, BIM has evolved from a simple 3D drawing tool to a comprehensive platform that integrates spatial relationships, geographic information, and building component properties. The application of BIM in construction project management has been steadily growing, thanks to its ability to improve collaboration and reduce errors. By enabling stakeholders to access a single centralized model, BIM provides opportunities for real-time updates and conflict detection. This can reduce rework by up to 40% and shorten the entire project duration by 7-10% (Wu et al., 2022). However, this growth still has enormous potential within the entire industry. A systematic review of 166 peer-reviewed researchs in a study found that the integration of BIM with project management processes is still in its infancy, but it shows great potential in risk mitigation, schedule optimization, and cost control (Azhar, 2011).
It is worth noting that BIM is very valuable in building renovation and long-term maintenance. It can help calculate renovation costs more accurately and manage the facilities after completion. In renovation projects, BIM can quickly analyze the impact of design changes, such as material usage and waste generation. On the other hand, the data exchange between BIM and traditional scheduling software such as Primavera and MS Project is not smooth enough and lacks unified standards (S ö derlund et al., 2024). The granularity between different BIM software (such as Revit, ArchiCAD) is difficult to align, coupled with the reluctance of enterprises to share their data, which hinders the collaboration efficiency of all parties in large-scale projects.
#### 2.2.2 Parametric Design
Parametric design is a method of automatically generating different design schemes by adjusting values such as size, angle, material, etc. It no longer relies on fixed graphics, but uses rules and logic to create models, allowing designers to quickly try multiple solutions and balance appearance and functionality (Sadeghi et al., 2023). In the field of architecture, parametric design can optimize performance such as lighting, temperature, and structure. Research has found that when combined with environmental simulation software such as Radiance and Daysim, parametric tools can automatically analyze the effects of different designs, resulting in a 20% increase in building energy efficiency (Khosrowshahi and Arayici, 2012). In addition, it can also help architects balance aesthetic, structural, and environmental requirements in the early stages of design (Sadeghi et al., 2023). In construction, parametric design can reduce errors and improve quality. By setting parameter rules, it is possible to automatically check whether the design meets the standards and construction requirements, avoiding expensive modifications in the later stage. The integration of parametric design and BIM is gradually advancing in the industrial sector. For example, tools such as Grasshopper and Dynamo can be linked with BIM software to achieve automatic data updates. This integration not only simplifies the design process, but also supports more advanced features such as automatically generating solutions while calculating material usage.
#### 2.2.3 Non-Convex Optimization
The core of seeking the optimal placement plan, from the perspective of mathematics and computer science, is essentially a non convex optimization problem. Non convex optimization is the process of solving optimization problems that do not meet the conditions of convex optimization. Non convex problems may have multiple local optimal solutions, even saddle points, making the solving process complex and challenging. The optimization problem of floor tile design involved in this research is also a non convex optimization problem. Although it is theoretically difficult to guarantee finding the global optimal solution, researchers have made significant progress in non convex optimization algorithms in recent years.
For example, the SPIDER-ADMM algorithm combines the SPIDER gradient estimator with the alternating direction multiplier method (ADMM) to achieve approximately optimal incremental first-order oracle complexity in non convex optimization, significantly improving the efficiency of solving large-scale problems (Huang et al., 2020). The SICBO algorithm introduces smoothing techniques and consensus based optimization methods, and proves the exponential convergence of its solutions for non smooth and non convex problems, ensuring stability and global optimality in complex problems (Wei&Bian, 2025). In addition, the DADANC algorithm improves the stability and convergence speed of the algorithm in distributed non convex non concave minimum maximum optimization problems by introducing momentum mechanisms and consensus steps, making it suitable for optimization tasks in multi-agent systems (Tran Dinh et al., 2024). Future research may continue to explore new algorithmic frameworks, such as combining quantum computing techniques, to further enhance the solving ability of non convex optimization.
#### 2.2.4 Floor Tile Planning
There have been some targeted studies on tile laying planning at the engineering level. This problem can be summarized as a two-dimensional cutting problem (2D-CSP). In such problems, it is necessary to cut large tiles into suitable small pieces to cover the entire room and minimize the generation of waste (Wu et al., 2021). Although earlier methods such as linear programming can calculate the optimal cutting scheme in simple situations, it is difficult to transfer to complex shaped rooms or special paving methods such as diagonal paving and staggered paving. BIM technology is the cornerstone of research and application in tile laying planning. For example, research has developed a Revit based tool that can automatically read room dimensions and tile specifications, calculate the most material efficient laying method, and reuse corner materials. It is said that this method can reduce waste by 15% -20%. In addition, the tool can automatically generate cutting lists and paving diagrams, allowing workers to construct more accurately and reduce errors. More advanced technologies can also consider multiple factors simultaneously, namely multi-objective optimization (MOO), such as material waste, construction difficulty, and aesthetics. There are also studies that combine ArchiCAD (BIM) and Grasshopper (parametric design), using genetic algorithms to identify multiple feasible solutions and their cost data, allowing users to choose the most satisfactory paving method on their own. (Wu et al., 2023)
### 2.3 Critical Analysis of Previous Research
Current research acknowledges the limitations of applying new technologies in the actual brick laying workflow, particularly in terms of material waste and construction efficiency improvement. (Wu et al. 2022a, According to Wu's research in 2022b, traditional design aids have not fully considered the cutting rules and construction experience of floor tiles, resulting in a material waste rate of over 10%. However, Xu et al. (2023) further emphasized that current BIM systems focus more on the architectural design phase, with insufficient consideration for the procurement and construction phases. This fragmented process management seriously restricts the depth of tile design optimization.
Previous studies have mostly attempted to digitize the layout and cutting process of floor tiles through algorithmic means, in order to minimize material waste and construction complexity as much as possible. (Wu et al., 2022b) formalized the industry's "empirical pruning rules" through parametric modeling, constructed a global "pruning and allocation" algorithm, and combined it with evolutionary algorithms (EA) to automatically generate optimized layout solutions. Similarly, Xu et al. (2023) proposed a goal-directed design framework that allows users to customize cost weights (such as waste rate, cutting complexity, and aesthetics), and the system selects the optimal design solution based on the weighted total cost. This method of considering user preferences significantly enhances the applicability and intelligence level of the system, especially suitable for scenarios with complex layouts and significant differences in demand. Researchers have also attempted to combine multi-objective optimization (MOO) methods with BIM and PD platforms to optimize the layout, cutting schemes, and construction efficiency of floor tiles (Wu et al., 2022a; Wu et al., 2022b; Xu et al., 2023).
Many researchers have adopted commonly used visual programming tools and CAD tools in the industry. However, most researchers' algorithm implementations are completed on other specialized platforms (such as Pycharm and other IDEs), which face many problems when collaborating across multiple platforms. There is still a significant gap between its integration and human-machine interaction performance and actual industrial applications. Among them (Wu et al. 2022a, In 2022b), ArchiCAD and Grasshopper were selected as the infrastructure for their BIM and PD platforms, achieving the integration of algorithm logic and visual modeling. However, Xu et al. (2023) emphasized the generality and platform independence of the algorithm, and their design framework was not bound to specific software, but proposed a "generic representation" to support multiple paving patterns and irregular floor tiles. This strategy enhances the universality of the algorithm and provides a foundation for future cross platform research and application.
A large number of studies have verified the effectiveness of its system in reducing material waste and improving construction efficiency through experiments. For example, (Wu et al. 2022a) achieved a material waste reduction of up to 12% and a 5% reduction in the number of cut pieces in the prototype system. Wu et al. (2022b) achieved a 14.58% and 11.46% reduction in waste rates in two different cases, respectively, and shortened the computation time by 17.3 seconds to 50.0 seconds. In contrast, the solution proposed by Xu et al. (2023) maintained a waste rate of 1.38% to 4.99% in multiple unit tests, far below the industry benchmark of 5% to 15%. This indicates that the current technology has preliminary potential for engineering implementation.
At the level of algorithm design, many studies have adopted evolutionary algorithms or their variants as the core computing engine for layout optimization. Researchers have specifically introduced the "shortest distance selection method" to assist users in making rational choices between multiple optimization solutions. This method was originally used for calculating macro indicators, but has shown good performance in transferring to spatial design optimization problems (Wu et al., 2022a). Some people have used weighted objective functions to comprehensively consider multiple indicators, thereby achieving multi-objective optimization solutions (Xu et al., 2023). Although the complexity of algorithm models varies, they all emphasize the importance of transitioning from "empirical design" to "data-driven optimization". On the other hand, these studies have shown insufficient sensitivity to new algorithms. For example, the evolutionary algorithm and annealing algorithm mentioned above are relatively outdated algorithms. However, research achievements in the field of pure mathematics have generally not received much attention, and these research methods focus on direct solutions rather than relying on iterative optimization.
In terms of engineering practice contributions, Wu et al. (2022a, 2022b) focus on construction management and achieving sustainability goals. The system they proposed can not only generate construction drawings, but also provide specific cutting dimensions and layout patterns, providing direct guidance for frontline construction personnel. In contrast, Xu et al. (2023) emphasize more on the flexibility and universality of the system, and attempt to extend this method to a wider range of cutting optimization scenarios in the home decoration industry, such as cabinet panels, wall tiles, etc. This reflects two process optimization trends: on-site construction oriented and factory prefabrication oriented.
The current research has made outstanding contributions, but there are also several research gaps and room for improvement. Firstly, existing research mainly focuses on two-dimensional layout optimization, and has not fully considered the three-dimensional factors during the construction process, such as floor height differences, structural column interference, etc., which have an impact on tiling. Secondly, although all papers emphasize "sustainable development" and "reducing waste", there is a lack of reasonable measurement methods. For example, the increase in working hours caused by the increase in construction complexity has not been added to the total cost through a reasonable method. At a deeper level, there is a lack of systematic modeling of ecological indicators such as carbon emissions and transportation route optimization during the construction process. In addition, most current systems rely on specialized modeling and programming platforms, and their universality and integration still need to be further improved to meet the application needs of small and medium-sized construction enterprises. As for the algorithm part, it also reflects the lag compared to the achievements of computer science and mathematics. Some of the latest algorithms are still to be referenced.
In summary, the current research on optimizing tile laying has made contributions and pointed out further research directions. By formalizing industry experience into algorithmic rules and combining multi-objective optimization techniques, researchers have developed a prototype system that can effectively reduce material waste, improve construction efficiency, and output visual construction drawings (Wu et al., 2022a; Wu et al., 2022b; Xu et al., 2023). Among them, parametric modeling provides design flexibility for the system, BIM platform ensures information traceability and construction feasibility, and optimization algorithms become the core of the system's "intelligence".
Multiple non convex optimization algorithms can be used to address the challenges posed by complex design spaces, among which differential evolution and Bayesian optimization have been applied to this problem. However, some updated algorithms, such as RBFOpt and CMA-ES, have not yet been validated. The differential evolution algorithm was proposed by Storn and Price in 1997. As a population-based heuristic optimization method, its core lies in guiding the search process through differential mutation, crossover, and selection operations (Storn&Price, 1997). DE exhibits strong global search capability in dealing with multi-modal, nonlinear, and non differentiable problems, making it suitable for situations in tile design where the global optimal solution needs to be found in a high-dimensional parameter space. Especially when the objective function has multiple local minima, DE can still maintain good global exploration ability. Bayesian optimization (BO) takes the DE method a step further and uses surrogate models for global optimization, making it particularly suitable for problems where function evaluation is expensive or unsolvable. It predicts the objective function value of unknown points by constructing a probability model (usually a Gaussian process), and uses a collection function to select the next evaluation point, gradually approaching the optimal solution within a limited number of evaluations (Frazier, 2018). In the design of floor tiles, due to the complexity of the cost calculation function, each calculation takes a long time. BO can effectively reduce the cost required for optimization. CMA-ES was developed by Hansen et al. and is currently the most stable evolutionary strategy, adept at handling high-dimensional, non convex, and multimodal optimization problems. Its uniqueness lies in the adaptive update mechanism of the search distribution covariance matrix, which can continuously improve search efficiency and directionality (Hansen, 2016). CMA-ES has potential application value in the adjustment of tile parameters. RBFOpt is a derivative free global optimization method designed for black box optimization tasks, which approximates the objective function using radial basis functions and performs optimization searches on it (Gutmann, 2001). For the issue of high cost simulation involved in tile design, RBFOpt can construct a reliable approximate model with a small number of samples, achieving better results within a limited evaluation budget. Compared with CMA-ES, its computational cost is greatly reduced.
In summary, BO and RBFOpt have more advantages in evaluating higher costs; SCA can provide more stable solutions under design constraints with certain structural convexity. The RBFOpt method is the first and most suitable approach for the problem described in this research.
### 2.4 Summary
The optimization problem of brick laying design is an important topic in the field of construction that combines theoretical complexity and engineering practicality. Its research is related to the optimal allocation of material resources and the improvement of construction efficiency. From an engineering application perspective, the maturity of Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology provides a highly integrated data platform for brick laying design, enabling automatic selection and adjustment of component information, dynamic adjustment of spatial layout, and real-time linkage with construction plans. At the same time, the development of parametric design tools further rationalizes spatial problems, making it possible to quickly model complex geometric shapes and automatically derive brick laying logic. At the theoretical support level, this problem can be abstracted as a tiling problem or an optimal covering problem, and its solving process often faces a large number of combinatorial solution spaces and multiple constraint conditions, such as the comprehensive consideration of factors such as tiling integrity, material cutting loss minimization, and construction aesthetics.
With the recent development of computer science, especially in the field of artificial intelligence, research based on heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms has gradually become the mainstream direction. In recent years, various optimization algorithms, including evolutionary algorithms and Bayesian optimization, have been successfully applied in brick laying design. These algorithms simulate the evolution and learning mechanisms of nature and demonstrate strong global search and convergence performance in nonlinear and multi-objective problems. Many research results have verified their superiority in practical engineering cases, not only improving the rationality and economy of brick laying layout, but also significantly reducing material loss rate and construction time cost. And some unverified latest achievements, such as covariance matrix adaptive evolution and RBFOpt, can construct reliable approximate models with a small number of samples, which have great potential for application.
However, there is still a certain research gap in the field of optimizing brick laying problems. On the one hand, most existing methods focus on the application and improvement of traditional algorithms, and have not fully considered the potential of the latest artificial intelligence algorithms in such problems. On the other hand, existing research often focuses more on algorithm performance indicators, while neglecting engineering constraints such as practical construction feasibility and human-machine collaborative design interfaces. Therefore, future research should further expand the boundaries of algorithms, introduce interdisciplinary fusion methods, enhance the adaptability and universality of models to practical scenarios, in order to achieve a leap from "solvable" to "efficient and practical". By introducing unexplored emerging algorithms and systematically comparing them with existing methods, it is expected not only to improve the accuracy and speed of solving brick laying design problems, but also to promote the development of the entire construction optimization field.
## 3 Research Method
### 3.1 Introduction
To evaluate the potential of RBFOpt algorithm in optimizing flat tiling, this paper constructs a research framework from algorithm design to experimental verification, and then to result analysis. In the algorithm design phase, the author formalized the plane embedding problem as a type of constrained black box optimization task. The author constructed a cost calculation tool through a parametric design platform and, given geometric boundaries, material specifications, and construction rules, introduced the RBFOpt algorithm based on a radial basis function surrogate model to solve the problem with the objective function of minimizing the total cost. During the experimental verification phase, ten representative room plans were selected to construct a test set, and multiple sets of instances were generated with the help of graphics processing software. The test was run multiple times under different random initial conditions. The result analysis stage will evaluate the performance of the RBFOpt algorithm in multiple scenarios through data evaluation indicators obtained from the above experiments, including cost savings rate, iteration convergence times, and stability under different instances.
### 3.2 Algorithm Design
#### 3.2.1 Objective Function
The core objective of this study is to verify the performance of the RBFOpt algorithm in finding the optimal solution with the goal of minimizing the total cost. Although some previous literature has proposed a research approach of multi-objective optimization, such as using the quantity of ceramic tiles as a direct objective while considering other indirect objectives such as construction convenience and material waste rate (Wu et al., 2021), these studies have not effectively clarified the inherent connections between the objectives and the allocation ratios of various factors, but have further increased the complexity of problem modeling. In practical applications, there is often a cross coupling and mutual constraint relationship between these objectives, which significantly increases the difficulty of modeling and optimization.
Given that this study aims to compare and analyze the performance of different algorithms in optimizing tile laying problems, in order to avoid interference with the evaluation of algorithm performance due to complex objective settings, this paper simplifies the optimization objective and only takes minimizing the overall cost as a single objective function. This simplification strategy does not ignore the practical significance of multi-objective optimization, but is based on the premise that enterprises usually further model and optimize in the industrial application stage according to specific project requirements and resource conditions in engineering practice.
Specifically, the overall cost includes material costs, labor costs, transportation costs, and other indirect expenses. To simplify modeling and calculation, this research only includes two direct cost factors, material cost and labor cost, as components of the objective function. Among them, the material cost is calculated based on the total number and unit price of tiles used in the laying plan; The labor cost is quantified based on the additional working hours caused by on-site cutting operations during the construction process, and is converted into a specific cost value by referring to the relevant labor quota prices and network data in the 2024 edition of the Rawlinson Construction Cost Handbook.
In terms of modeling, Wu et al. (2021) proposed that the decision variables in the tile laying scheme can be expressed as the "starting point" of each tile. The starting point is set in a Cartesian coordinate system established with a corner of the room as the origin, and its coordinate values fall within the range covered by a single tile area. Therefore, the starting coordinates of each tile constitute the key decision variables in the optimization problem, and all solutions are determined by these variables.
Firstly, all variables to be discussed are defined below.
- C_total:	Total cost
- C_"mat": 	Material cost
- C_lab:	Labor cost
- N_full:	Number of full tiles
- N_cut:	Number of cut tiles
- N_total:	Total number of tiles
- N_cutOp:	Number of cutting operations
- P_unit:	Price per tile
- R_cut:	Cuts per hour
- W_hour:	Hourly labor cost
- L_f:	Tile length
- W_f:	Tile width
- x:	Starting X-coordinate
- y:	Starting Y-coordinate
- A:	Floor Area

Using p to represent the starting point of laying, and x and y to represent the coordinates of the starting point, the following function can be obtained:

![](FOLIOPICS\postGrad\fuc1.png)

Since the coordinates of p do not exceed the range of a single tile, the following constraints can be obtained (for ease of calculation, the actual tile length and width are set to 100, and a relative coordinate system is established):

![](FOLIOPICS\postGrad\fuc2.png)

Therefore, the corresponding relationship between the objective function and decision variables can be represented by a function:

![](FOLIOPICS\postGrad\fuc3.png)

The target solution is (Wu et al., 2021):

![](FOLIOPICS\postGrad\fuc4.png)

#### 3.2.2 Cost Calculation Model
In this study, a geometric and cost model was constructed using the parametric design tool Grasshopper, which can automatically calculate the total cost C based on the starting coordinates p of floor laying. The total cost includes the consumption cost of flooring materials and the labor cost converted from the additional working hours generated by on-site cutting operations. The basic inputs required for model operation include the floor plan outline of indoor rooms, floor unit price, time required for a single cutting operation, and unit labor cost.
The specific calculation process is as follows: Firstly, starting from the specified starting coordinates, a continuous array of floor block matrices is generated within the room range according to preset rules, and the topological relationship between each floor and the room contour is sequentially determined. Based on the judgment results, the system divides the floor into three categories: floor completely located inside the contour, floor intersecting with the contour line, and floor completely outside the contour. Only the first two categories will be retained for subsequent laying optimization analysis.
For the floor intersecting with the contour, the system cuts it along the room boundary to form multiple irregularly shaped cutting pieces. Next, analyze each cutting piece one by one to find geometric complementarity, that is, whether it can be combined with another cutting piece to form an approximate rectangle. If there is a matching relationship, record it as a "splicing pair" for material reuse in subsequent laying. Afterwards, further check whether the remaining cutting pieces can be covered by other larger floor cutting edges, thereby reducing the overall floor consumption.
Through the above process, the system will ultimately generate a complete laying plan at the current starting point, including the actual number of required floor tiles and cutting operations. On this basis, when calculating material costs, multiply the number of floor panels by the unit price of a single floor panel; When calculating labor costs, combine the number of cutting times and single cutting time, the number of laying pieces and laying time, and multiply them uniformly by the labor cost per unit time. The total cost corresponding to the starting point can be obtained by adding the two together.
The specific calculation process can also be expressed as follows.

The calculation process in Grasshopper is as follows:

#### 3.2.3 Optimization Procedure
In order to build a brick laying optimization tool, the author designed an automated process based on BIM and PD. Firstly, import the indoor floor plan outline and the length and width dimensions of the tiles, and set multiple default initial starting points. Then calculate the total cost based on the above data. Afterwards, the above information will be input into the RBFOpt module and undergo multiple iterations to gradually approach the optimal laying starting point.
The basic process of RBFOpt is: first, perform initial sampling in the design space to obtain a batch of input-output data; Then use this data to train a random forest regression model to approximate the true objective function. Next, the collection function (such as Expected Improvement) is calculated through the proxy model to quantify the potential for obtaining better solutions at each candidate point. Due to the fact that random forests do not directly provide prediction variance, RBFOpt typically estimates uncertainty through the predicted distribution of each decision tree, thereby constructing a collection function. In each iteration, the algorithm maximizes the collection function, selects the next most promising sample point, evaluates the true objective function, and adds the results to existing samples to update the surrogate model. This process is repeated continuously until the set termination conditions are met, such as reaching the maximum number of evaluations or no significant improvement in the objective function.

### 3.3 Test
#### 3.3.1 Test Environment
All optimization experiments in this study were conducted in a unified hardware and software environment to ensure the reliability and reproducibility of the results. The experiment was conducted on a laptop equipped with an AMD Ryzen 7 5800H processor, 16 GB of memory, and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 3050 graphics card, running on Windows 11. This hardware configuration is common in the architectural design industry and has good graphic processing capabilities, making it easy to perform large-scale geometric modeling and visualization operations.
In terms of software platform, this research uses Rhinoceros 8 and its parametric modeling plugin Grasshopper as the core tool for modeling and cost calculation of floor laying schemes. Grasshopper is used to dynamically generate floor laying matrices at different starting points, simulate cutting operations, and calculate corresponding material and labor costs based on input parameters. In order to achieve efficient collaboration between optimization algorithms and geometric models, this experiment will reference the Grasshopper plugin Opossum developed by researchers at the University of Stuttgart to use the RBFOpt algorithm, and set the end when there are no optimizations after more than forty iterations (Uni shutgart. de. 2019).
#### 3.3.2 Performance Evaluation Indicators
In order to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and adaptability of the method applied in this research under different indoor floor layouts, the author will mainly focus on several representative performance indicators. These indicators can indicate the quality of the results and the convergence speed and operational stability of the algorithm.
The core indicators are the minimum total cost and cost improvement rate. The minimum total cost is the lowest total cost corresponding to the optimal laying starting point obtained in each test case. In order to measure the economic benefits of algorithms in practical applications, this research introduces a relative comparative indicator, namely the cost improvement rate. This indicator is used to compare the cost difference between optimization results and the current industry average. This indicator can intuitively reflect the benefits brought by the algorithm in reducing material waste and labor costs.
In terms of algorithm efficiency, the main measure is the convergence speed. Firstly, by drawing the convergence curve of the objective function value with the number of iterations for visual analysis, the evolution trend of the algorithm from the initial solution to the optimal solution is displayed; At the same time, record the number of iterations required to reach the convergence standard as a direct indicator for quantifying the convergence speed. In addition, the stability and generalization ability of the algorithm will be evaluated by assessing the standard deviation of the test results of each case, and factors related to algorithm efficiency will be identified through regression analysis.
#### 3.3.3 Test Case
In order to test the applicability and universality of the proposed optimization method in actual residential spaces, this paper selected the floor plans of ten representative Australian single story residential buildings (including detached houses and apartments) as test cases. These residential floor plans come from multiple channels, mainly mainstream rental and sales platforms in Australia. By selecting representative residential types, this research covers as many common indoor spatial forms in the current housing market as possible.
To test the adaptability and stability of the optimization algorithm under different geometric constraints, the selected residential areas are mainly concentrated between 20 and 100 square meters, all of which are single stories. These floor plans have high spatial diversity, including different layouts such as rectangles, L-shaped, T-shaped, and some cases with obvious irregular contours.
Before formal testing, all residential floor plans were uniformly imported into the Rhino platform and preprocessed through scale adjustment and ground contour extraction. Subsequently, these two-dimensional contours were transformed into recognizable closed polygons in Grasshopper, which were used as input boundary conditions for optimizing the model. In order to ensure consistency in comparison, all test cases were optimized using the same specifications of floor tiles, the same labor cost parameters, and cutting time settings. The unit price and labor cost of the floor tiles used for testing refer to the relevant labor quota prices in the 2024 edition of the Rawlinson Construction Cost Handbook and typical prices provided through online channels. The experiment tested 10 different building plans, with each case tested twice.

In order to evaluate the performance of the new algorithm, the author will calculate the cost of common flooring methods in the industry and compare them. The general method of laying flooring in the industry refers to starting from any corner of the room and reusing the cut waste based on experience. The cost simulation of this method is achieved by calculating from any corner of the room and only searching for suitable waste materials in the order they were previously cut when using waste materials.
## 4 Results & Discussion
### 4.1 Material Utilization Efficiency
#### 4.1.1 Comparison of Saving Rates Across Cases
When conducting empirical testing on the proposed optimization algorithm, statistical data showed that the proportion of optimized costs to baseline costs (i.e. residual rate) was highest at 89.17%, lowest at 78.56%, average at 83.72%, and average savings rate at 16.28%, demonstrating significant cost reduction effects in most room laying tasks.
From the distribution of data, the residual rate is mainly concentrated between 80% and 90%, and there is still a large fluctuation range between different cases. The standard deviation of the optimized cost ratio is 0.0333, indicating that the algorithm exhibits high consistency in different cases. Meanwhile, the coefficient of variation is 0.0398, further indicating that the fluctuation of the results is relatively mild and the overall saving ability is relatively robust.

Table 1 Test performance (By Author)

Although the overall trend is stable, there is still a certain gap between the extreme values of the savings rate, indicating that algorithm performance may decrease in certain special scenarios or complex geometric structures. Preliminary speculation suggests that this fluctuation may be related to factors such as room area, shape complexity, or material arrangement direction.
#### 4.1.2 Relative Analysis
In order to explore the impact of room area on the optimized material saving rate, this paper uses a linear regression model for analysis. The results showed that the Pearson correlation coefficient between area and residual rate was 0.444, indicating a moderate positive correlation; The coefficient of determination R ² of the regression model is 0.197, which means that room area can explain about 19.7% of the change in savings rate, indicating that it affects the optimization results to some extent.

Further analysis of variance results showed that the F-value of the regression model was 4.42, corresponding to a P-value of 0.0499, which was lower than the significance level of 0.05, indicating that the impact of area on the savings rate had insufficient statistical significance. Although it is initially believed that larger room sizes are more likely to achieve higher material savings, existing data does not strongly support this inference.
### 4.2 Convergence Speed
#### 4.2.1 Visualization of Convergence Curves

![](FOLIOPICS\postGrad\fig7.png)

Figure 7 Convergence Curves of all cases (By Author)

The above figure summarizes the iterative convergence curves of the RBFOpt algorithm under two independent tests in ten building plans with different geometric features, totaling 20 optimization trajectories. In each small graph, the horizontal axis represents the number of iterations, and the vertical axis represents the total pavement cost (in AUD) corresponding to the current optimal solution. The blue curve represents the evolution of cost with iteration, the red dashed line represents the baseline of the case (110% of the final solution), and the intersection of the blue and red lines indicates the number of iterations required for the algorithm to reach convergence tolerance.
Overall, RBFOpt exhibited the characteristic of "first urgent and then gradual" in all tests. The rapid cost reduction in the early iterations proves that the algorithm has a strong ability to improve the initial solution in the global exploration stage; Subsequently, the algorithm entered into local refinement search, and the curve tended to flatten, indicating that the algorithm achieved gradual approximation of the optimal solution domain through multiple rounds of updates to the proxy model. On average, the number of convergence iterations for 20 tests is about 75. There is a significant fluctuation in the convergence speed between two tests of the same case. Taking Case 5 as an example, the convergence point of the first test appeared around the 170th round, while the second test only required about 120 rounds; Case 1 increased from 120 rounds to 160 rounds, which may be due to the algorithm's sensitivity to random initial samples. In addition, the magnitude of the cost curve decline and the position of the inflection point also suggest the potential impact of certain factors on algorithm performance. Some studies suggest that complex geometry often requires more iterations to explore high-quality solutions through surrogate models, while simple geometry can converge faster to near optimal costs (Jones et al., 1998; Regis&Shoemaker, 2005).
#### 4.2.2 Iteration Count to Convergence
This experiment is set as a mechanism with a maximum iteration of 40 iterations and automatic termination without progress. However, in actual experiments, some cases ended prematurely without meeting the conditions. To uniformly evaluate the convergence efficiency of the proposed algorithm, this study uses "the difference between the solution and the final value does not exceed 1%" as the convergence criterion, and records the number of iterations required for each case to reach this criterion.
The statistical results show that the number of iterations required for convergence varies greatly among different cases. Among them, the fastest convergence occurred at the 29th iteration, the slowest at 170 iterations, and the average number of convergence iterations was 75.60. This indicates that although the algorithm as a whole has high convergence efficiency, it will exhibit significant differences when faced with different cases. The analysis of the standard deviation and coefficient of variation of the data confirms this statement. The standard deviation is 44.03 and the coefficient of variation is 0.582, indicating that in some cases, the convergence performance of the algorithm has strong inconsistency. This may be influenced by multiple factors such as the complexity of room layout, geometric shapes, or initial algorithm conditions.
Overall, although the convergence speed varies in different scenarios, the overall convergence ability is good, and most cases have completed the optimization process within 100 iterations, which is in line with the expected algorithm efficiency in engineering practice. Subsequent research may consider strategies such as initial solution guidance and parameter adaptive adjustment to further improve the convergence consistency and speed of the algorithm in complex situations.
#### 4.2.3 Relative Analysis
To investigate whether the convergence speed of the algorithm is affected by the size of the room, a linear regression analysis was conducted with the room area as the independent variable and the number of iterations required for convergence as the dependent variable. According to the regression results, the coefficient of determination (R Square) obtained is 0.0000033, indicating that the explanatory power of area on convergence speed can be almost ignored. The significance test result of the regression coefficient (P value of 0.9939) is much higher than the conventional significance level (such as 0.05 or 0.01), indicating that the null hypothesis cannot be rejected statistically. In addition, the adjusted coefficient of determination (Adjusted R Square) is negative (-0.0556). From the residual analysis of the regression model, the variance of the error term (MS Residual) is 2046.59, which reflects the extremely poor fitting effect of the model. This indicates that the current linear model not only cannot effectively describe the relationship between variables, but may also cause fitting errors due to noise. In summary, based on the sample data, the convergence efficiency of the algorithm is not significantly affected by the size of the room area. The complex relationship between convergence efficiency and different cases still needs to be explored.

### 4.3 Conclusion
The experimental results show that the algorithm can effectively reduce material waste in most cases. Small fluctuations and good stability. The explanatory power of area on savings rate is limited, and other factors such as layout complexity may have a greater impact. The low standard deviation and low coefficient of variation indicate that the algorithm has strong anti-interference ability for room structural differences, and the saving effect is stable and reliable. Even in complex scenarios, there have been no serious failures.
The overall convergence efficiency is good when measured by the standard of "1% difference from the final solution". Although some cases require more iterations, most converge within 100 iterations, which is suitable for engineering practice. In terms of convergence performance, there are significant differences in the algorithm's performance in different cases, with some cases having longer computation times and more local optimal traps.
In summary, although the algorithm exhibits good robustness in material saving, there is still room for optimization in convergence speed. In the future, we can improve overall performance by introducing complexity quantification indicators, adding multi strategy initialization or local disturbance mechanisms, optimizing stopping criteria, and dynamically adjusting parameters.
## 5 Conclusion Chapter
### 5.1 Algorithm Advantages
The optimization pavement design method based on RBFOpt algorithm proposed in this study demonstrates superior performance in multiple key dimensions and has high potential for engineering applications. Firstly, in terms of material utilization, this method exhibits significant and stable optimization effects. Experimental data shows that the average material saving rate is 16.28%, and in the vast majority of cases, the saving rate exceeds 80%, demonstrating the high adaptability and practical application value of the algorithm in different scenarios. Secondly, the RBFOpt algorithm also has certain advantages in convergence efficiency. Most test cases can meet the convergence conditions within 100 iterations, indicating their strong global optimization ability and potential to meet construction time constraints. In addition, from the perspective of algorithm universality, it can maintain good optimization performance in various geometric planes of different rooms, further verifying the adaptability of this method to complex parameter spaces. In summary, the RBFOpt algorithm has demonstrated comprehensive advantages in material cost control and geometric adaptability, and can be regarded as a paving optimization technology solution with good development prospects.
### 5.2 Limitations Analysis
The method of using RBFOpt algorithm to seek the optimal solution for tiling design has several limitations that need to be further overcome and improved in future research and development. Firstly, from the experimental data, it can be seen that the convergence speed of this method fluctuates significantly in different testing scenarios, reflecting its tendency to experience unstable computation time in environments with different geometric features. This volatility indicates that the algorithm is highly sensitive to the spatial structure of the case, and may require extremely long search times when dealing with complex boundary conditions or irregular planar shape patterns. Due to time and resource limitations, this study has not yet conducted a systematic exploration of the specific influencing factors and underlying reasons. For example, the complexity of indoor floor contours, the arrangement of material laying patterns, the selection of brick laying directions, and the coupling relationship between material dimensions and construction site conditions may all have a significant impact on the final convergence speed and optimization results. These latent variables may become key obstacles to the promotion and further development of this method. Meanwhile, the basic functions of the cost estimation module have been implemented, but the current cost calculation method still contains many redundant calculation steps and processes, resulting in low overall operational efficiency. Some of the calculation processes are relatively redundant, consuming a large amount of computing power resources, which limits the possibility of high-frequency use in practical projects. Therefore, in practical industrial applications, a more systematic reconstruction and optimization of this module is needed. 
### 5.3 Prospect
The research findings have significant practical value for small and medium-sized enterprises as well as individual professional contractors in optimizing cost control during the construction process. With the help of the tools developed in this study, contractors can more accurately formulate material cutting and paving strategies, effectively reducing cost losses caused by material waste and manpower redundancy. After considering the additional costs of transportation, loading and unloading, and on-site storage of building materials, the actual savings are expected to further increase. Translating the results of this research into commercially deployable products still faces certain challenges. The main technical bottleneck at present is that the hardware performance of mobile terminal devices is still unable to support the real-time computing requirements of high complexity algorithms. Therefore, future work will focus on lightweight and modular design of algorithms and programs, striving to achieve smooth deployment and efficient operation on mobile devices while ensuring algorithm effectiveness, and promoting their development towards commercialization and industrialization. Based on this study, the next step of work can focus on optimizing algorithms, as well as lightweight and modular design of programs, to enhance their deployment potential on mobile devices while maintaining optimization performance. This is based on the reality that the hardware resources of mobile terminals used in the current industrial sector are limited. Small and medium-sized enterprises and individual contractors are the true executors of tiling. They generally do not have specialized equipment and rely solely on mobile phones and laptops for office work. Their devices often struggle to meet the real-time operational requirements of high complexity optimization models. Therefore, to transplant the pavement optimization method mentioned in this research to resource constrained devices, it is necessary to minimize the algorithm load through methods such as model compression, structural simplification, and process optimization. Lightweight design can reduce the parameter size and computational cost of the model, and significantly reduce energy consumption during operation, which is of key significance for construction auxiliary decision-making that pursues high-frequency and instant response. Long et al. (2024) pointed out that in optimizing model deployment, lightweight architecture can effectively balance model performance and computing resource consumption, providing a feasible path for embedded and mobile applications. By reducing memory calls, optimizing data structures, and removing redundant computing steps, the algorithm's runtime can be significantly shortened, enhancing its practicality in construction environments. The tool provided by the author focuses on the cost calculator for two reasons. Firstly, there are a large number of processes that are stored and calculated using data structures of surfaces and curves, and in reality, these processes can be replaced in a more concise way. Secondly, the dependence on parametric design software makes it impossible to complete algorithm optimization from the bottom layer. For example, the representation of geometric shapes and geometric calculations are more redundant due to their dependence on software platforms. If you want to invest in industrial applications, you must refactor the code from the bottom. In addition, modular design has a significant promoting effect on the maintainability and cross platform compatibility of the system. In pavement optimization scenarios, there may be significant differences in the input dimensions, constraint rules, and output formats of algorithms for different projects. Modular architecture can decouple algorithm logic, user interaction, data interface, visual output and other parts, making the entire system more flexible and adaptable, and providing great convenience for other researchers and enterprises to call the tools described in this research in the future. As Restackio (2025) emphasizes, in edge computing and AI deployment, modularity is the basis for ensuring the stable operation of algorithms, and can realize component updates without sacrificing response speed. Furthermore, in order to promote the further commercialization and industrialization of this technology, it is necessary to establish standardized data interfaces and service agreements to ensure seamless integration of algorithms in various third-party BIM platforms, construction software, mobile applications, and web applications. At the same time, attention should be paid to user experience design, developing user-friendly visual interfaces, lowering professional barriers, and enhancing the willingness and ability of small and medium-sized enterprises to use them. Springer (2018) also pointed out in his research on the RBFOpt algorithm that the promotion and application of optimization algorithms in industry must rely on the continuous improvement of open architecture, standard compatibility, and system integration capabilities. Based on the above premise, the tools described in this study are expected to be implemented and commercialized, providing convenient and effective value management solutions for the industrial sector.
